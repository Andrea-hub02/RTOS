## Description
&emsp;&emsp; This will be a Smart Monitoring Trash System that will receive a signal everytime a trash is thrown into the trashcan. The ultrasonic jsn-sr04t sensor will determine the distance between the bottom of the container and the sensor; in order that when the sensor detects that the distance is bellow "certain centimiters" it will mean that the trash can is full and it is time to notify the user.
